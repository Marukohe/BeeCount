    <!-- WelcomeActivity -->
    <string name="hello">Welcome to BeeCount! The purpose of this app is to store count details for several knitting or crochet projects and allow you to count each separately. Each project may have multiple \'counts\', each being something such as a pattern repeat or a row which you wish to track. Use the buttons below to create new projects or manage existing ones.\n\n By editing a project after creating it you can also link counts together so that one increments another.\n\nSettings can be changed by accessing the menu on this screen (menu button or 3-dot overflow menu above).\n\nShould you have any questions you may visit the Ravelry group at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/beecount, or email bug reports to knirirr@gmail.com.\n</string>

    <string name="aboutCalc">This screen allows the calculation of increases or decreases using the \"magic formula\" - thanks to The Knitting Fiend (http://www.thedietdiary.com/blog) for permission to use these calculations. See below for more information.</string>
    <string name="perRow">Number of stitches in a row</string>

    <string name="decreaseUnbalanced">Decrease, unbalanced</string>
    <string name="calcTitle">Calculation results</string>
    <string name="calcExplanation">The unbalanced method reduces sort of evenly, but the first decrease and last decreases may be different distances from the edge. Sometimes, depending on the number of stitches in the row, this \"unbalanced\" decrease happens to work out the same as the next increase. For many items, this a perfectly good method to calculate decreases. Most people can also figure out that if they take stitches from the first groups and shift them to the end, things get more balanced.\n\n The balanced method is as symmetric as possible around the center stitch. It is a pain in the neck to calculate, but it prevents your sweater hem from shifting strangely to one side.  Some people don\'t ever bother to do make sure their increases are balanced and work unbalanced increases even when it matters. On the other hand, some people use the percentage method to calculate their sweaters and tolerate tight or loose sleeves, tight or loose armholes and other uncomfortable ugly knitting phenomena.</string>
